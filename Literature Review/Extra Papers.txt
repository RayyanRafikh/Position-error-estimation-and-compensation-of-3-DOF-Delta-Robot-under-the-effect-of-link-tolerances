1(3) uses cylindrical coordinate system for inverse kinematics instead of caresian coordinate system and verifies the same.
1(4) shows in very much detail the forward, inverse kinematics of the model and aan example of a software setup for the control of the delta robot.
1(5) tells us briefly about the serial and parallel manipulators and compares them too.
1(6) consists of deep(I did not understand) explanation of inverse dynamic model of parallel robot.
1(7) tells us in brief how the Delta robot was controlled using ROS.
1(10) - Delta Parallel Robot â€” the Story of Success by Ilian Bonev, it tells us briefly about the history of delta robots, their development in academia and industry, different versions of the delta robot.
1(11) tells us deeply about the mobile robot's path planning algorithms. 
1(12) is in Swiss language by Raymond Clavel.
1(13) tells poorly about the forward and inverse kinematics of delta parallel robots.
1(14) emphasises on Jerk-optimal trajectory planning for Stewart platform in Joint Space.
1(15) - Modelling and Simulation of Machine Tool Prototype with 6DOF Parallel Mechanism in Matlab / Simulink.
1(16) tells us briefly about the design of laser cutting machine using delta robot.
1(17) is an introductory chapter of a book written by Jean Pierre Merlet and Clement Gosselin.
